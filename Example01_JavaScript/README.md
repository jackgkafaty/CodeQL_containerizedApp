OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure web application! It can be used in security
trainings, awareness demos, CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses vulnerabilities from the
entire
[OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other security flaws found in real-world
applications!

[node.js LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) as close as possible. Docker images and packaged distributions are
offered accordingly.

There is no guarantee that older minor node.js releases will always work with Juice Shop!
Please make sure you stay up to date with your chosen version.
